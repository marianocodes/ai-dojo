## Handoff Notes for Team

**For Senior Software Architect**: This document provides the business context and functional requirements for the Socialgram layout system. The requirements focus on creating a familiar, accessible social media interface using our existing tech stack. Please design the technical architecture to fulfill these user needs while considering scalability for future feature additions.

**Scope Boundaries**: This document intentionally avoids technical implementation details - those decisions belong to the architecture and development phases. Focus is on user experience and business requirements.

**Questions/Clarifications**: If technical constraints affect these requirements, please flag them for product discussion before proceeding with architecture. Key areas to consider: responsive breakpoints, component reusability, and integration patterns for future features.
